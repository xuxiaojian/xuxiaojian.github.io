Nice to meet you here!

I am Xiaojian Xu, an enthusiastic researcher specializing in computational imaging. Currently, I am an AI Research Scientist with the Foundation AI team at GE HealthCare (GEHC), where I focus on developing large language models, foundational AI models, vision-language models, and multimodal models for medical imaging and healthcare applications.

Prior to joining GEHC, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the EECS department at the University of Michigan (UMich) from 2022 to 2024, luckily working under the guidance of [Prof. Jeffrey Fessler]( https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2022 from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU), where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html) in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG). Before my time at WashU, I completed my B.S. in Communication and Information Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014. I was admitted to the graduate program as an exam-exempt student and later earned my M.S. in Communication and Information Systems from UESTC in 2017.

My research interests span computational imaging, optimization theory, biomedical imaging, deep learning, generative AI, inverse problems, and computer vision. If you’re interested in our work, feel free to reach out!

Before I came to WashU, I got my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014 and then was recommend as an exam-free student to the graduate school of UESTC and later got my M.S. degree there in 2017. Back then, I majored in communication and information engineering and did most of my research in wireless and computer network engineering. It was a very helpful and interesting journey and I always appreciate what I have learned in that field. Besides, UESTC is located in Chengdu, a city full of good food. I enjoied my seven years there a lot!
I am always attracted by the beauty of mathematical analysis and I feel so lucky to be able to join the CIG group after I came to WashU. CIG is a pretty cool place and I learned a lot here from my advisor and groupmates. My research of interests includes computational imaging, optimization theory,computer vision and machine learning. Feel free to follow us if you think our research is interesting!
